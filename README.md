# 2x2_trackMultiplicity
This repository contains essential analysis codes for DUNE Near Detector Prototype (aka 2x2) Charged Track Multiplicity analysis.

The main analysis file is ``analysis.cc``. I am cleaning, refining and adding comments to this script for better understanding. Will update with an enhancced version of it over the next few days.
